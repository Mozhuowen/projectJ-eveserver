    Eve Demo
    ~~~~~~~~

    A demostration of a simple API powered by Eve REST API.

    The live demo is available at eve-demo.herokuapp.com. Please keep in mind
    that the it is running on Heroku's free tier using a free MongoHQ
    sandbox, which means that the first request to the service will probably
    be slow. The database gets a reset every now and then.
